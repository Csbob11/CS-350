Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    
    The major project that I worked on was a thermostat. Using the TI SimpleLink CC3220S microcontroller LaunchPad development kit, it used a user-defined       temperature. It used a sensor to compare the input against the temperature set by the user. Using buttons on either side of the development toolkit, the user could adjust the temperature. LEDs on the toolkit simulated the heat. 
    
What did you do particularly well?
    
    Overall I think my code was okay. I was able to implement timers and interrupts well. 
    
Where could you improve?
    
    There is some work that could be done to improve. Unfortunately I was unable to get the buttons to respond as I kept receiving an error. I was unable to get the code composer studio program to detect and interact with the device for some reason on this project. More time could be spent figuring out what exactly was preventing communication and try to get the program to access the board. 
    
What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    
    I spent a good amount of time using the zybooks to correct and use code to try to accomplish the goals of this project. 
    
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    
    The skills and knowledge I gained in regards to performance will definetly be relevant in the future no matter what field I enter. The experience with timers and interrupts should be beneficial as well. The extra practice writing code and implementing best coding practices will also be helpful. 
    
    
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

To help ensure this project was maintable, readable and adaptable, I tried to implement best coding practices like following naming conventions and keeping the code simple. I also tried to make sure I commented the code to help keep it readable and easy to understand what I did and why I did it.
